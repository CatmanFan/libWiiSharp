If you want to contribute, you can do so at [the github repo](https://github.com/TheShadowEevee/libWiiSharp).

Some modifications have been pulled from many different mods of libWiiSharp in order to make a more universal version of the library that doesn't need individual changes. If this version of libWiiSharp fails to replace a different version, open an issue and provide the source code, or if need be the dll, and an attempt will be made to incorporate the custom mod into this version of libWiiSharp.
